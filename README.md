## Properties Of This Lecture

 Hello, guys! Welcome to my "Learning C++" Repository!!
 First of all, I guess I should let you know me. Actually, I'm from Korea(I'm a NATIVE!). 
 My major is Physics and Computer Science. This Lecture(Repository) will teach you about `Basic C++`.
 - If you watch and study C++ lecture through my class constantly, you can become Basic C++ Master!!
 - This class will use English. Also, Kor Ver. will be made.
 - I won't teach you any useless grammar or key-word. By the way, in case, I'll add extra python application at APPENDIX.
 - After studying these programming lectures completely, you can make some programs anywhere, anywhen!
