# Main_Lecture(2) : Data Type and Variables
## 2.1 What are the Data Types and Variables on C++?

### 2.1.1 Data Types (Basic)
When we make some programs or codes through coding(programming), a concept of `data type` is really important. I'll regard people in this page as those who have experienced any other programming language such as C, Go, Python and so on. So, I'll explain the concept on this page. However, I wanna emphasize the importance of this concept, so that I'll add here one website explaining about a concept of data type: <여기는 자료형에 대한 설명이 나온 웹페이지 주소>  


#### 2.1.1.a Integer Type 
:) `Integer Type` represent integer number such as -2, -1, 0, 1 and 2. However, this type includes a lot of details along ranges able to express, sizes able to do and so on. Typically, `(signed) short (or shor int)`, `unsigned short`, `(signed) int`, `unsigned int`, `(signed) long` and `unsigned long` belong to Integer Type.  


:) Before you learn about Data Type, you should know one thing: 1Byte = 8bit And, 1 bit can be expressed as 0 or 1. Thus, 1Byte is 8bit, so the number of signs, that a computer can express, is 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 = 2^8 (=256).  


:) First, I'll explain about differences between `signed` and `unsigned`. If
