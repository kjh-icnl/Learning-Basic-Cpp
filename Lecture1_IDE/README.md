# Main_Lecture(1) : IDE
## Kinds of IDE
  1. Dev C++  
  
     * This IDE is made for only C/C++.  
     * So, it is really basical.
     
  2. Visual Studio (VS)  
  
     * This lecture will ***USE THIS*** IDE
     * Programming on this IDE is really useful on a lot of aspects.
  
  3. Visual Studio Code (VSC)
     * I'll recommend VSC instead of VS if you think your compurter is not that good so you can't use VS.
     * VSC is a lighter version of VS.
     
  4. And so on
     * If there is any IDE you used to utilize, then **use it**.
     * Or you can use other IDEs if you wanna utilize them.
     
 > **NOTE :** ***This Lecture will be written by standard of Visual Studio.***
